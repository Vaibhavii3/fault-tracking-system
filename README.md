<h2><b><center>fault-tracking-system</center></b></h2>

<p> A Transformer is heart of power system. Transformer is made from two coils of wire, a primary coil from the ac input and a secondary coil leading to the ac output. A fuse is an electrical safely device that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it. As we all knows that GEB’s workers have to go different place to check the fuse melt or not.</p><br>
<p> A fuse break the circuit if a fault in an appliance causes too much current to flow. This protects the wiring and the appliance if something goes wrong. If the current going through the fuse is too high, the wire heats up until it melt and breaks the circuit And also the GEB workers don't know about this things that which area the fault is occurs So we provide this project to help to the workers that when any fault occurs into the system and when fuse break the circuit, at that time workers know about the area of the fault and location of the fault. Our project is provide the system to the GEB workers about fault of fuse with exact location by massage. </P>

<b>Atmega328</b>
<p>The Atmega328 is a very popular microcontroller chip produced by Atmel. It is an 8-bit microcontroller that has 32K of flash memory, 1K of EEPROM, and 2K of internal SRAM. It is one of the microcontroller chips that are used with the popular Arduino Duemilanove boards. They comes with either 1 of 2 microcontroller chips, the Atmega168 or the Atmega328. Of these 2, the Atmega328 is the upgraded, more advanced chip. Unlike the Atmega168 which has 16K of flash program memory and 512 bytes of internal SRAM, the Atmega328 has 32K of flash program memory and 2K of Internal SRAM. It has 28 pins.</p>
<b>Relay Driver</b>
<p>A relay driver circuit is a circuit which can drive, or operate, a relay so that it can function appropriately in a circuit. The driven relay can then operate as a switch in the circuit which can open or close, according to the needs of the circuit and its operation.</p>
<b>Relay</b>
<p>A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.</p>
<b>wi-fi Module</b>
<p>The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. The ESP8266 is capable of either hosting an application or offloading all Wi-Fi networking functions from another application processor.</p>
<b>Oscillator circuit</b>
<p>An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. Oscillators convert direct current from a power supply to an alternating current signal.</p>
<b>Voltage measurement circuit</b>
<p>Voltage Measurement Overview. Voltage is the difference of electrical potential between two points of an electrical or electronic circuit, expressed in volts.It measures the potential energy of an electric field to cause an electric current in an electrical conductor.</p>
<b>Temperature measurement circuit - LM335</b>
<p>The temperature sensor is LM335 which has a linear characteristic of 10mV / K . In the production process this electronic device is calibrated so can provide 2.73V at 0°C.LM336 is used as a very precise 2.5V Zener diode; CA3040 amplification can be adjust between 1.08 and 1.10 times thru P1. This temperature measurement circuit can be used for Fahrenheit measurements, in this case the freezing point is adjusted with P1 at 32°F. At 212°F, P2 is adjusted to obtain 0.9V at output. So 1°F correspond to 5mV.</p>
<b>Current measurement circuit</b>
<p>Current is the measure of the rate of electron “flow” in a circuit. It is measured in the unit of the Ampere, simply called “Amp,” (A).</p>
<b>Reset circuit</b>
<p>A power-on reset (PoR) is a circuit that provides a predictable, regulated voltage to a microprocessor or microcontroller with the initial application of power. The PoR system ensures that the microprocessor or microcontroller will start in the same condition every time that it is powered up.</p>
<b>Transformer</b>
<p>A Transformer is heart of power system. Transformer is made from two coils of wire, a primary coil from the ac input and a secondary coil leading to the ac output</p>
<b>Current transformer</b>
<p>A current transformer (CT) is a type of transformer that is used to reduce or multiply an alternating current (AC). ... Current transformers are the current-sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations, electrical substations, and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution.</p>
<b>LCD</b>
<p>A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.</p>
